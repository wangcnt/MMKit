 * Each MMservice must have its own identifier, cos the most tasks are
 * asynchronous, some tasks may need to access the property of MMService even
 * in the underlayer, such as the important property MMService.invalid, now the
 * MMServiceID will be your key to touch the MMService.
 *
 * Default identifier and serviceKey will be a uuid string.
 *
 * It passes through MMService, then MMOperation, & then MMRequest.
